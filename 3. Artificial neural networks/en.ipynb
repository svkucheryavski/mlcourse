Neural networks have proven to be powerful for solving complex problems of classification and other tasks. In this class, we will explain the basics of neural networks, their components, training process and validation of ANNs.\n",

The most known are [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) (there is also a library which takes the best of both, [Keras](https://keras.io)). For the examples in this class we will use PyTorch, which is, in these days, probably the most widely used and well documented. \n",

There is a set of basic instructions which tell how to build a foundation of the house, set drainage pipes etc. Plus it has some typical instructions, e.g. how to make a brick wall. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, so when you want to make instructions for a building a full house (a typical project), with walls, roof, etc. you can take the basic set as a basis and extend it with your own part. \n",

You simply take it as a basis and extend with your own specific parts — which nodes to use, how many inputs they have, how many outputs, etc. So this new set of instructions is the class `SimpleModel`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**You can think of `__init__()` as a method that builds the house using your instructions.** Not painted, without furniture, but a whole, fully functioning house. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second method in this class, `forward()`, is used every time you want to apply your model for given inputs to produce the output. The method \"connects\" the neurons, it makes sure that the inputs go through the neurons in a correct order and returns the resulted output at the end.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**You can think of `forward()` as a method that lets you use the house you have created.** It is always used in its current state. So if you apply method `forward()` to newly created house, it will not perform well as your house has bare walls and no furniture. But you can live there of course.\n",

    "One of the reasons to use Torch tensors instead of NumPy arrays is that the tensors are designed to work with [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) — the powerful graphic cards we have e.g. in gaming computers. Moreover it works only with specific GPU, made by company [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/da-dk/geforce/graphics-cards/). If you are gamer you probably heard about graphics card like GTX 3090. Because ANNs require a lot of computer power, using GPU makes them much faster and PyTorch is made to work on GPU first. If you do not have GPU, it can also work on conventional processor, but the computation will be slow. Especially if you have large datasets with thousands of objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "Loss function is used not only for assessing the quality of the predicted values, but also for computing gradients for the weights — how the weights must be changed in order to get a smaller loss at the next iteration (improve the model). \n",
    "\n",
    "The gradients are increments for the weights, $\\Delta w_1, \\Delta w_2, \\Delta w_3, \\Delta w_4$ and for the bias, $\\Delta b$, which are used to compute new weights for the model. The simplest way to compute the new weights is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$w_1 = w_1 - \\alpha \\Delta w_1$<br>\n",
    "$w_2 = w_2 - \\alpha \\Delta w_2$<br>\n",
    "$w_3 = w_3 - \\alpha \\Delta w_3$<br>\n",
    "$w_4 = w_4 - \\alpha \\Delta w_4$<br>\n",
    "$bias = bias - \\alpha \\Delta b$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see above, the increments are not used as is, but there is an additional parameter $\\alpha$, which must be between 0 and 1. For example, if $\\alpha = 0.01$, the change in weights  will be 1% of the computed increment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $\\alpha$ is called a *learning rate* and it is needed to slow down the learning process and make it more smooth. You will see some examples later in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradients are computed by the loss function object (in example above it is `nn.MSELoss()`), while updating the weights is done by another function — *optimizer*. There are several optimizers available, usually one of the following two is a good choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *GD* or *SGD* (stochastic gradient descent) — the simplest optimizer, which works exactly like shown in the equations above. Simple and straightforward. The name *gradient descent* means that you compute gradient in order to find steps for the weights which let go down (descent) in the loss.\n",
    "* *Adam* is more sophisticated optimizer which updates weights in a bit more complex way than as shown above. It has more parameters to tune and usually is more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all examples we will use *SGD* as it is more simple, but you can try *Adam* later. \n"

    "1. Apply ANN to compute outputs based on inputs from the training set.\n",
    "2. Compute loss based on the current output and the desired output values.\n",
    "3. Compute gradients and update weights, so next time the loss value is smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is called *forward propagation* because data values flow from the left (inputs) to the right (outputs) through all neurons in between (we have only one neuron so far in our model, but it does not matter — what works for one will work for thousands). \n",
    "\n",
    "The third step is called *back propagation*, because the gradients are computed for the output neuron first. Then for the neurons left to the output, and so on, until all neurons get the new weights updated based on the gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three steps are repeated until a criterion is met, for example loss does not get smaller anymore. Every time a model takes all three steps for all rows of the training set it takes an *epoch*. So if you run training process for 10 epochs, it means this three steps are repeated 10 times for all rows of the training set.\n",

This helps to avoid overfitting, when you train your model too long and it performs worse on the validation set than e.g. 50 epochs before. We will consider this case in the next class.\n",
